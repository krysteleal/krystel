            My journey didn't start in Silicon Valley - it started in France and Portugal. Born in France but raised in Portugal, I made a bold decision at 19 to move to Paris on my own to study Communication at Sorbonne University.
            <br /><br />
            At the time, I was certain I would become a journalist. I loved language, storytelling, and the power of words to shape knowledge. But life had other plans. Instead of reporting the news, I found myself diving deep into the digital world - building projects, learning WordPress, and eventually becoming a freelancer.
            <br /><br />
            From my first digital projects and later moving to the Bay Area, every step along the way shaped how I think about technology, business, and career growth.

                    I remember spending hours reading blogs on Blogger and LiveJournal whenever I was allowed to use the computer. My fascination turned into trying to figure out how they appeared on screen, and that's when I discovered HTML and CSS. That was the beginning of my journey into the web.

                    That early passion for the digital world never left me. I was fascinated by how things appeared on a screen, how people connected through content, and how knowledge spread online.

                    So, when I finished high school in Portugal, pursuing Communication felt like the obvious choice. I was drawn to journalism - I loved language, storytelling, and the ability to shape perspectives. It seemed like the perfect fit.

                    But moving to Paris alone at 19 was more than just starting college - it was a crash course in independence. To support myself, I worked multiple jobs:<br />
                    ü•ê At a bakery (a dream for anyone living in Paris!)<br />
                    üçî Fast food chains<br />

                    And every night, after long shifts, I'd come home and read about "digital nomads" building businesses online. I realized that the digital skills I had learned as a teenager - HTML, CSS, and content creation - had real value. I started teaching myself WordPress development, became obsessed with SEO, and learned how content was king at the time.

                    By 2015, I had built a solid portfolio, a steady stream of clients, and was earning more money freelancing than in any job I had before. That's when I made the decision: I wasn't just going to get a job - I was going to build my own career, on my own terms. I became a full-time freelancer.
