                    The Silicon Valley approach to Customer Success fundamentally changed my perspective. 
                    Instead of viewing CS as a reactive support function, I learned to see it as a 
                    proactive driver of growth. In the Valley, CS teams are strategic partners that 
                    help shape product development, drive adoption, and directly impact revenue.
