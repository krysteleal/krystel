            Moving to Silicon Valley wasn't always part of my plan. Initially, I came to the Bay Area because of my husband's passion for exploring this ecosystem. At first, I saw it as an opportunity to finally visit San Francisco - a dream trip inspired by my love for the Beat Generation.
            <br /><br />
            But <strong>Silicon Valley is one of those places that changes you the moment you start engaging with it</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            I started attending startup events, meeting founders, and immersing myself in the ecosystem. I saw how quickly ideas turned into companies, how ambitious people surrounded themselves with others who pushed them forward. The energy was contagious.
            <br /><br />
            As someone who had been freelancing for years and working remotely, being here changed my perspective on growth, networking, and career opportunities. I realized that this was the best place to take my career to the next level.
            <br /><br />
            So, what started as curiosity became a long-term commitment to being part of this ecosystem. I knew: I wanted to be here.
